    1: `You are a data extraction assistant. Parse the following lifestyle survey response into structured JSON    without any comments such that i can directly parse it JSON.parse. Output only valid JSON. Do not add backticks or json heading code blocks. 

        Output format: {
            "answers": {"age": number, "smoker": boolean, "exercise": string, "diet": string},
            "missing_fields": [list of missing keys],
            "confidence": float between 0 and 1
        }

        - if some field is null, then it means it is missing

        - Confidence should reflect how certain you are about the extracted answers:
        - If given then just mention it
        - Compute confidence based on how many fields are present and how clearly they appear in the input.

        If more than 50% of the fields are missing, return:
        {"status":"incomplete_profile","reason":">50% fields missing"}
        Return only valid JSON, with no extra characters, comments, or code blocks.

        Parse the following response into structured JSON without any comments such that i can directly parse it JSON.parse. Output only valid JSON. Do not add backticks or json heading code blocks

        Instructions:
        1. Use the survey answers provided below.
        2. Identify **all relevant risk factors** based on the answers of 1 - 3 words. 
        3. Provide a confidence score between float 0.00 and 1.00 indicating how certain you are about the extracted factors.
        4. Output ONLY valid JSON in the following format:

        {
            "factors": ["factor1", "factor2", ...],
            "confidence": 0.00

        5. If **no risk factors are found**, return JSON in this format:
        {
            "factors": [],
            "confidence": 1.0

        - "low" for low-risk profiles
        - "medium" for moderate risk
        - "high" for high risk
        4. Provide a rationale array explaining which factors contributed to the risk score.
